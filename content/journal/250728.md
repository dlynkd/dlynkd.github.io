Err(()) matches an error with the unit type; Err(_) matches everything.

Prefer to return early with one match statement instead of nesting them. This avoids unnecessary indentation and means error/exit conditions are handled upfront and are easier to read.  
> This follows the "fail fast" key principle.  
> Easier to read and audit, reduces mental load, more idiomatic.

Don't fail early when cleanup or state rollback is required before exiting, or if nested contexts need to share state/mutability, although this is usually a signal to refactor.
