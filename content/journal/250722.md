Integers default to i32 and floats to f64.

Numeric literals can have underscores inserted to improve readability, the underscores have no affect on the number.

`1_000` = 1000 or `0.000_001` = 0.000001.

Rust also supports scientific notation: `1e6` = 1,000,000.

Functions can use tuples to return multiple values of multiple types.
