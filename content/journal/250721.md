`write!` can be used to help define Display for custom types that need to be iterated over, by using the `?` operator.

The `?` operator will return an error if it breaks but will otherwise continue to the next `write!` statement.

There are alternate forms for some formatting parameters, like `{:#08X}`, which will prefix uppercase hex with 0x and pad with 0's until the total length is 8: `0x000000`.
