Tuples use dot notation to access elements, not bracket notation.

Tuples more than 12 elements can't implement Debug.

Array type signature `:[T, length]` will initiate an array of that type of that length.

Slices are similar to arrays, but their length is *not* known at compile time; their type signature is `&[T]`.

`.len()` returns the count of elements in an Array.

Arrays can be automatically borrowed as slices: `&array`.

OOB indexing on an array causes a compile time error, but OOB indexing on a slice causes a runtime error.
