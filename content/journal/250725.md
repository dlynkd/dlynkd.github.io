If an enum or funtion or any other object expects an owned argument to be passed to it, you can use `.to_owned()` on a reference to pass it.

On a `&str`, `to_owned()` is equivalent to `.to-string()` as they would both convert to a String.

`to_owned()` can be used on any type with the ToOwned trait, while `to_string()` can be used on any type with the Display trait.

`&self`, `&mut self` are temporary borrows to allow access to data from the instance of the object that function is called from, usually in an `impl` block. Using `self` would transfer ownership and invalidate the original instance after the function has completed.

You can make an enum alias with type keyword `type AliasName = VeryLongEnumNameForThings;`
