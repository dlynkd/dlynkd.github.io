Use `Box<dyn std::error::Error>` when your function returns a `Result<T, E>` and `E` can be many types of errors. This is common when reading a file and deserializing.

Magic strings are unnamed, hardcoded string values used in logic. They seem convenient at first but are a bad idea for a few reasons:  
1. Typos cause issues → runtime errors.  
2. Can't rename all occurrences easily.  
3. No autocompletion.  
4. No context — meaning is unclear, hard to maintain.  
5. No compiler checks.  

Use enums or constants where possible.

For matching what would otherwise be a magic string, using an enum with a `match` block that utilizes `eq_ignore_ascii_case("str")` is a much safer and idiomatic choice.

Use a path type instead of a string when working with files. It improves readability as it is clearly a file name/path, has cross-platform compatibility between UNIX systems and Windows. `Path` and `PathBuf` come with more useful APIs like `.exists()`, `.extension()`, `.file_name()`. They also have more composability in concatenating paths and offer stronger type safety.
