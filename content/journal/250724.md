Nested destructuring can be used on structs containing structs to assign variables.

Example on a Rectangle made from Points to assign four variables:

```rust
struct Point {
    x: f64, 
    y: f64,
}

struct Rectangle {
    top_left: Point,
    bottom_right: Point,
}

let Rectangle {
    top_left: Point{x: x1, y: y1},
    bottom_right: Point{x: x2, y: y2},
} = rectangle
```

This will assign the x & y coords of the Points in an instance of Rectangle (called rectangle) to variable names: x1, x2, y1, y2.
