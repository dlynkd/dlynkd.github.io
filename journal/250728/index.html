<p>Err(()) matches an error with the unit type; Err(_) matches everything.</p>
<p>Prefer to return early with one match statement instead of nesting them. This avoids unnecessary indentation and means error/exit conditions are handled upfront and are easier to read.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This follows the "fail fast" key principle.<br />
Easier to read and audit, reduces mental load, more idiomatic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don't fail early when cleanup or state rollback is required before exiting, or if nested contexts need to share state/mutability, although this is usually a signal to refactor.</p>
